# GraphFrames: A Hello World

A quick "Hello World" for GraphFrames. This hands-on guide 
is meant to lower the entry barrier to [GraphFrames](https://graphframes.github.io/index.html).

It largely contains existing examples from the [Quick Start](https://graphframes.github.io/quick-start.html) and 
[User Guide](https://graphframes.github.io/user-guide.html) arranged in a structure which can be reproduced by users in an IDE of their choice.
All additional comments are my own.

## Note

This repo ships with the required JARs in `lib/`. Though this is bad practice, I've included the JARs for ease of reproducibility.
These can also be found at [Spark Packages](http://spark-packages.org/package/graphframes/graphframes)
